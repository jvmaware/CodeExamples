This is an example for a blog post published on [jvmaware.com](https://jvmaware.com/blog/streaming-json-response/) describing how to implement 
json streaming using `StreamingResponseBody`.

The example includes the following components:

1. **streaming-server**: A REST api to stream json records.
2. **streaming-client**: A demo implementation of the streaming client using a custom `RestTemplate` **Response Extractor**.
